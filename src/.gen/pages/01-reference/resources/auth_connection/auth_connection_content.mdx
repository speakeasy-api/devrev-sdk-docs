## Auth Connection

### Available Operations

* [Create](/auth_connection/create) - Creates a new enterprise authentication connection for a Dev
organization. This authentication connection will not be enabled by
default for the organization and the user will need to explicitly
enable this. Keep in mind that at a time, only one authentication
connection can be enabled for a Dev organization. At present, only 5
enterprise connections can be created by an organization.

* [Delete](/auth_connection/delete) - Deletes an authentication connection. Only enterprise connections which
are explicitly set up for a Dev organization can be deleted. Default
connections can not be deleted using this method.

* [Get](/auth_connection/get) - Retrieves the details for an authentication connection.
* [Post Get](/auth_connection/post_get) - Retrieves the details for an authentication connection.
* [List](/auth_connection/list) - Lists all the authentication connections available for a Dev
organization. This list will include both social and enterprise
connections which are either available by default or are explicitly
created by the user.

* [Post List](/auth_connection/post_list) - Lists all the authentication connections available for a Dev
organization. This list will include both social and enterprise
connections which are either available by default or are explicitly
created by the user.

* [Toggle](/auth_connection/toggle) - Enable or disable an authentication connection for a Dev organization.
Currently, only 1 authentication connection can be enabled at a time.
When a new authentication connection is enabled, the connection which
is currently enabled for the Dev organization is automatically
disabled.

* [Update](/auth_connection/update) - Updates an authentication connection.
